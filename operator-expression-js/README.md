Great! Here’s a simple, clear, and class-friendly breakdown of your **JavaScript Operators & Expressions** topic. I’ll explain each part with small examples so you can understand and even use it to explain to others during a class lecture.

## 🎯 JavaScript Operators & Expressions

### ✅ What is an *Expression*?
An **expression** is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

📌 Example:
```js
5 + 3         // Expression (evaluates to 8)
"Hello" + " World"  // Expression (evaluates to "Hello World")
```

## 1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform basic mathematical operations.

| Operator | Description    | Example       | Result |
|----------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| `+`      | Addition        | `5 + 2`       | `7`    |
| `-`      | Subtraction     | `5 - 2`       | `3`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication  | `5 * 2`       | `10`   |
| `/`      | Division        | `10 / 2`      | `5`    |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder) | `10 % 3`  | `1`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation  | `2 ** 3`      | `8`    |

---

## 2️⃣ Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values and return `true` or `false`.

| Operator | Description         | Example       | Result     |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|------------|
| `==`     | Equal (loose)       | `5 == '5'`    | `true`     |
| `===`    | Equal (strict)      | `5 === '5'`   | `false`    |
| `!=`     | Not equal (loose)   | `5 != '5'`    | `false`    |
| `!==`    | Not equal (strict)  | `5 !== '5'`   | `true`     |
| `>`      | Greater than        | `5 > 3`       | `true`     |
| `<`      | Less than           | `3 < 5`       | `true`     |
| `>=`     | Greater or equal    | `5 >= 5`      | `true`     |
| `<=`     | Less or equal       | `4 <= 3`      | `false`    |

---

## 3️⃣ Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions.

| Operator | Name      | Example             | Result     |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| `&&`     | AND       | `true && false`     | `false`    |
| `||`     | OR        | `true || false`     | `true`     |
| `!`      | NOT       | `!true`             | `false`    |

📌 Example:
```js
let age = 20;
if (age >= 18 && age < 30) {
  console.log("You're young and allowed!");
}
```

---

## 4️⃣ Template Literals (`${}`)
Template literals allow you to embed variables or expressions inside a string using **backticks (`)**.

📌 Example:
```js
let name = "Nijhum";
let age = 22;

console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`);
// Output: My name is Nijhum and I am 22 years old.
```

You can also do calculations inside `${}`:
```js
console.log(`5 + 5 = ${5 + 5}`); // Output: 5 + 5 = 10
```

---

## ✅ Summary:
- **Arithmetic** = for math.
- **Comparison** = to compare values.
- **Logical** = for combining conditions.
- **Template literals** = to create readable strings with variables or expressions.
