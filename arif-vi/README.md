Now, let's dive deep into each topic with examples and clear breakdowns. I‚Äôll start with the first one and explain them in order. Let me know if you'd like the explanations all at once or step-by-step. Here‚Äôs the first:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why JavaScript is Not Multi-Threaded

JavaScript is **single-threaded**, meaning it executes one operation at a time on a **single call stack**. It was originally designed to run in the browser to provide interactive web pages, where **concurrency was not a primary concern**.

However, JS handles asynchronous operations (like API calls, timers, etc.) using the **Event Loop**, **Web APIs**, and **Callback Queue**‚Äîallowing it to be **non-blocking** while still being single-threaded.

#### Example:
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Callback after 2 sec");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**
```
Start
End
Callback after 2 sec
```

Although `setTimeout` seems to run in parallel, the **timer is handled outside the main thread** (via browser‚Äôs Web API), and the callback is pushed back to the call stack **after 2 seconds**, enabling the illusion of multi-threading.

#### So what is ‚Äúmulti-threading‚Äù?
It means running multiple pieces of code at the same time, literally. JavaScript doesn‚Äôt do this natively, but modern environments (like browsers) provide **Web Workers** and **Service Workers** that offer real multi-threading capabilities.
